<h2><b>Monthly retail trade growth rate revisions</b></h2>
<h3>This little website presents information about the revisions to the monthly estimates of the growth rate of Canadian retail trade. The revisions can be reviewed either for total retail trade or for any of 29 industries and sub-industries comprising retail trade. You select an industry from the box above.</h3>
<h3>In this analysis, the term <i>reference month</i> refers to a particular month for which growth rate revisions are being examined. A given reference month, for example August 2017, will be characterized by an initial growth rate estimate, calculated using the retail trade level estimates for that month and the previous month as they stood when that initial growth rate estimate was released. In this example, the release would have been in October 2017, since there is a two-month release lag. Thereafter, there will be additional estimates for the growth rate in that reference month. In the example just given, the first <i>revision</i> will be in November 2017, the second in December 2017 and so on. The analysis here is focussed on the first four such revisions. Each of the monthly real retail trade growth rates for reference months between February 2015 and December 2020 is included in the analysis. Note, however, that the one-month-early 'flash' estimates that were introduced in 2020 are not included in this analysis.</h3>
<h3>The first estimates for a given reference month 'm' are released two months after the end of that month. Then, as the estimates for subsequent reference months are released, the estimates for month 'm' are revised over and over again. The revisions are based on new incoming information. Some of that is simply late responses to the monthly surveys and administrative data sources that are used to estimate retail trade. The seasonal adjustment is also redone every month and this can also bring revisions.</h3>
<h3>This website displays the properties of the monthly retail trade revisions. They are shown both for total retail trade and for 29 industry sub-components. The information here is derived from the data in Statistics Canada table 20-10-0054-01, which contains all of the 71 'vintages' from January 2015 to date.<h3>
