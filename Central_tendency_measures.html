<h2><b>Measures of central tendency and dispersion</b></h2>
<h3>The little table below shows three measures of central tendency for the first four revisions to the monthly retail trade growth rate. These measures are calculated using the entire revisions record from February 2015 to date. The first revision is one month after the initial estimate is released, the second two months after and so on. The average revision is an indicator of bias. It should be near zero if there is no bias, but if there is a tendency in the process to revise upward more often and/or by larger amounts, for example, then this would be a significant positive number. The mean absolute revision and the root mean squared revision are two measures of dispersion. They show how widely dispersed the percentage revisions have been over time. Clearly it is quite possible for the estimates to be unbiased (average revision of zero) while still having considerable dispersion or variance around that zero mean.</h3><br>
