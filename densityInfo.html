<h2><b>Estimated probability densities</b></h2>
<h3>Given the observed sample of revisions to the retail trade growth rates, it is possible to estimate the associated probability densities. Doing so essentially involves plotting a histogram (frequency distribution) and fitting a curve to it. (The area under the density curve is equal to one.) The estimated probability density shows the relative likelihood that the growth rate revision for any given month will lie within any given range. Ideally the density curve will be symmetric, centred on zero and very tall and narrow, implying no positive or negative bias and small probability that a revision will be far from zero. If the density is heavier on one side of the zero line than on the other, a bias is indicated. The densities are usually shaped like bell curves, though they need not be. The estimated probability densities are shown for each of the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-month- later revisions to the growth rate.<br><br>
