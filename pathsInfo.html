<h2><b>Revision time paths</b></h2>
<h3>The available sample of retail trade revisions extends from February 2015 to date. If all twelve months of the year are treated as homogeneous, this creates a fairly large sample of 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-months-later revisions. In the set of tables below, however, <i>all</i> of the revisions to date have been plotted. This allows one to see how the estimated retail growth rate in a particular reference month has evolved over time.</h3>
<h3>Each little chart pertains to a particular reference month, as indicated in its title box. For example, the first chart is for February 2015. The black line is a plot of the successive estimates of the retail trade growth rate for that particular reference month. The title box also shows the range of revisions over the period, which is to say the difference between the maximum and minimum estimates. Ideally the range will be near zero. If the range is not near zero but instead is substantial, then ideally the revision path will be from the initial estimate to the final estimate in a timely and direct movement. In any case, direct paths up or down are to be preferred. When the path moves up, then down, then up again this is disconcerting, unless of course the range is small, in which case any oscillations are of minor importance.</h3>
<h3>The revision paths for estimates in 2015 are six years long, but of course the path lengths get shorter for reference months closer to the present day. Nevertheless it is of particular interest to examine the revision ranges for the reference months in 2020, during the pandemic. This was a tumultuous period in which the revisions were unusually large.</h3><br>
