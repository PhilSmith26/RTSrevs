<h2><b>Autocorrelation diagrams</b></h2>
<h3>The autocorrelation diagrams show how today's revisions are related to the revisions in previous months. For example, if the first revision to reference month 'm' was positive, was the first revision to reference month 'm-1' also positive (or negative)? Does such a correlation also exist between the first revisions to reference months 'm' and 'm-2', or 'm' and 'm-3'? Normally we should expect these autocorrelations to be near zero, but if they are substantially different from zero that might signal some kind of ongoing changes to the retail trade survey itself. Note that the first autocorrelation shown in these diagrams is between the revisions to month 'm' and month 'm' which, of course, is always 1.</h3><br>
