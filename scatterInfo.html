<h2><b>Scatter diagrams</b></h2>
<h3>It can be useful to look at the growth rate revisions in a scatter diagram, to get a sense of the variability and whether it may be changing through time. Observing the outliers can also be instructive. Here we present four such diagrams, one for each of the (i) one-month-later revisions, (ii) two-months-later revisions, (iii) three-months-later revisions and (iv) four-months-later revisions. Note that the x-axis values in the chart are ordered from February 2015 to December 2020, corresponding to those reference months. Of particular interest are the apparent revision outliers in 2020, when the pandemic shutdowns occurred. The estimates for several retail industries were affected.<br><br>
